1. What is the main function of phloem in plants?
Answer: Phloem is responsible for transporting the soluble organic material created during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.

2. How do root hairs help with the process of transportation in plants?
Answer: Root hairs increase the surface area of the roots, allowing for increased exchange of water and minerals, which are essential for transportation.

3. How does osmosis contribute to transportation in plants?
Answer: Osmosis is the movement of solvent molecules from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration, which helps in the transport of nutrients and water in plants.

4. What is the process by which water is transported from the roots to the leaves in plants?
Answer: The process is called transpiration, which is the loss of water in the form of water vapor from stomata present on leaves.

5. How does transpiration help in the transportation of water in plants?
Answer: Transpiration creates a straw-like effect, pulling water up against gravity through tubes made of xylem cells, which transport water and other nutrients from the roots to other parts of the plant. (Timestamp: 2024-01-13 10:17:55)

Q: What is the function of a fuse in an electrical circuit?
A: A fuse is a safety device that breaks the circuit if the current becomes too high, protecting the appliances and preventing electrical fires.

Q: How do series and parallel circuits differ?
A: In a series circuit, all components are connected in a single loop, while in a parallel circuit, components are connected in multiple branches. In a series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in a parallel circuit, the current is divided between the branches.

Q: What is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit?
A: The relationship is described by Ohm's Law: voltage (V) = current (I) x resistance (R).

Q: How does a battery produce electricity?
